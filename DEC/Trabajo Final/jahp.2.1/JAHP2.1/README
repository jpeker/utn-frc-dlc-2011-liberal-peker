Introduction to JAHP
====================


JAHP is designed for single users who are making personal
decisions. This software, a Swing based user interface, help you to
achieve a better, faster and more justifiable decisions with a
structured decision-making approach based on the AHP.

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a powerful and flexible
decision making process to help people set priorities and make the
best decision when both qualitative and quantitative aspects of a
decision need to be considered. By reducing complex decisions to a
series of one-on-one comparisons, then synthesizing the results, AHP
not only helps decision makers arrive at the best decision, but also
provides a clear rationale that it is the best. Designed to reflect
the way people actually think, AHP was developed more than 20 years
ago by Dr. Thomas Saaty and continues to be the most highly regarded
and widely used decision-making theory.
